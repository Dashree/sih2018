Read/Write Video frames in Python using FFMpeg

Streaming Guide for FFMpeg
https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/StreamingGuide

Encoding for streaming sites
https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/EncodingForStreamingSites
This guide assumes that you will be using the libx264 encoder, which currently offers the best possible quality at fast encoding speeds
[NITIN : Read this in detail. Includes parameters for scaling the encoded video stream at run time]

Creating Multiple Outputs in FFMpeg
https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Creating%20multiple%20outputs
This way ffmpeg can create several different outputs out of the same input(s). We can use it on 'worker' side to create multiple resolutions
at the same time

Build LIve video streaming server using FFMpege and Nginx RTMP module

[NITIN : This article uses NodeJS and MongoDB. We will not need that. But Nginx configuation option details are useful]
